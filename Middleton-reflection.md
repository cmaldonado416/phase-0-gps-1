What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? The relationship of git and github. Merge conflices.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Best practices for commit verbiage and github workflow. Reviewing the cloning process and the git push/pull commands to have all changes stored locally. Significance of origin in relation to master.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? Asked guide for clarification on git fetch and git pull. Asked pair how to utilize code block. Asked both for clarification of syntax within terminal and MD.
What still confuses you about Git? How git and github relate aside from commit/push/pull. Merge conflict clarified by processing one during GPS but need assistance and will attend office hours on initial submodule merge conflict created during earlier assignment.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? My first GPS was a success. Cynthia and I paired well together and were able to switch between navigator and driver fluently. The session helped me discover what GPS and DBC is all about as we have been reading and writing about these sessions for a week and jumping into it I was a good nervous. John was able to clarify specific concepts and point us in the right direction for our syntax mistakes.
