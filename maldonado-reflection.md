1.What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the session I was struggling with understanding the significance of a git commit. I was also struggling with knowing what should go in a commit message.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Best practices for a commit and generally for the github workflow

Clarifications around cloning and pulling- John showed us the need for pull command when we pulled up a document and it was blank

The concept of an origin as a remote was also clarified- I was unclear on whether the remote would always be origin and John let us know that 9 out of 10 times it would be

also playing around with creating a merge conflict to the solve it cleared up a lot of questions around how to deal with a mail marge and how to avoid one

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

asked when is it appropriate to start a new branch, and clarifications around how to start a new branch (the different commands)

the difference between git fetch and git pull- still slightly confused about this.

not sure if I asked outright but I am also still confused around the relationship between local git and remote github aside from adding, committing, and pushing changes

5. how was your first experience of pairing in GPS?

It was great! John jumped in exactly when we were confused. I had an easier time driving than navigating. Navigating was a challenge because I wanted to see what was going on Dane's terminal but also I had to focus on the next step.
